      "Tax preparation is more than filling out paperwork or a form on the computer. It's about
      getting to know people, and looking out for them. We wouldn't do business any other way."

    Seems like everyone wants to do your taxes these days. Large chains, CPAs, computer programs -
    even car dealers! At Tax Care, we do things differently. Our team works all year long to stay
    current with Federal and State tax law changes, and we take the time to get to know our clients
    and their tax needs personally. That's what Tax Care means - not just "doing your taxes", but <em
      >caring</em
    > about you and your family.
  </p>
  <p>
    Call us old-fashioned, but we believe that experience, personal service, and attention to detail
    shouldn't cost extra. You'll find that our fees are much lower than many competitors - even
    though our preparers are usually more experienced, and our capabilities match or exceed almost
    every other preparation service in the area.
