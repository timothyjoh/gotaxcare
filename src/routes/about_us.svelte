    When Tax Care first opened its doors in Harrisonburg, tax preparation was primarily done on
    paper - with no electronic filing or home tax software to rely on. Back then, people relied on
    Tax Care because of their attention to detail, superior knowledge, and the service that you can
    only seem to get from a family-owned business.

  <p>
    Today, much about taxes has changed - laws, deductions, preparation and filing options and more.
    What
    <em>hasn't</em> changed is Tax Care's continued care for their clients. It's no wonder that people
    from around the area - Harrisonburg, Dayton, Bridgewater, Timberville, and Broadway - have trusted
    Tax Care for decades.
